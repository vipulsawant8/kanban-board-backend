# Kanban Backend

RESTful backend for a **Kanban-style task management system** built with **Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**.

The API allows authenticated users to manage **lists and tasks**. Each list can contain multiple tasks, enabling flexible task organization based on user-defined list structures.

# Core Features

* Versioned REST API (`/api/v1`)
* JWT-based authentication
* CRUD operations for lists
* CRUD operations for tasks
* User-specific data ownership
* Request validation using schemas
* Centralized error handling
* Modular MVC architecture
* MongoDB database integration

# Data Model Overview

The backend follows this structure:

User → Lists → Tasks

Example:

```id="ahwmlv"
User
 ├── List
 │     ├── Task
 │     ├── Task
 │
 ├── List
 │     ├── Task
 │
 └── List
       ├── Task
```

Lists are **fully customizable** and created by users. Tasks belong to a specific list.

# API Modules

## Authentication

Handles user authentication and protected routes.

Features:

* User registration
* User login
* JWT token generation
* Route protection middleware

## Lists

Lists are containers used to group tasks.

Users can:

* Create lists
* Retrieve their lists
* Update list details
* Delete lists

Each list belongs to a specific user.

## Tasks

Tasks are items created inside lists.

Supported operations:

* Create tasks
* Retrieve tasks
* Update task details
* Move tasks between lists
* Delete tasks

Typical task fields include:

* title
* description
* list reference
* timestamps

# Security Features

The backend implements several security practices:

* JWT authentication
* Route protection middleware
* Input validation
* Centralized error handling
* Resource ownership checks

These ensure users can only access and modify **their own lists and tasks**.
